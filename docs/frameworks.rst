Python Frameworks
=================


Django
------

Django is a free open-source full-stack Python framework.
It tries to include all of the necessary features by default
as opposed to offering them as separate libraries.

Django uses its ORM to map objects to database tables.
The same code works with different databases and isn’t difficult to transfer
from one database to another.
The main databases that Django works with are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite,
and Oracle, but third-party drivers allow you to use others as well.


Flask
-----

Flask is a Python framework available under the BSD license.
It was inspired by the Sinatra Ruby framework.
Flask depends on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2template.

Flask’s lightweight and modular design makes it easily adaptable to developers’ needs.

Features
++++++++

* Built-in development server and a fast debugger
* Integrated support for unit testing
* RESTful request dispatching
* Jinja2 templating
* Secure cookies support (client-side sessions)
* WSGI 1.0 compliance
* Unicode-based
* Ability to plug in any ORM
* HTTP request handling


Dash
----

Dash is an open-source Python framework used for building analytical web applications.
It’s especially good for Python data scientists who aren’t very familiar with web development.

Dash applications are web servers that run Flask and communicate
with JSON packets over HTTP requests.
Their frontend renders components with React.js.

Apps developed with Dash are rendered in the web browser and can be deployed to servers.
This also means that Dash applications are inherently cross-platform and mobile-ready.
